# Quantum-Espresso
This repository was created to contribute some useful scripts to run the QE calculations.
The file calculation.sh contains a shell script framework. Was built based on Quantum Express v6.8 To compile the file run the command: 
  chmod +x calculation.sh
To execute, use the command:
nohup ./calculations.sh


This script was developed to calculate:
 1. Geometry
 2. Band structure
 3. Density of states

It's a basic but useful script. It was developed based on the input and output of the Quantum Espresso 6.8V
